# About DigiGarden
**DigiGarden** is my personal digital garden – place for putting links, drafts, ideas; currently concering anything related to the field of *data*.

Keep in mind that this is *not* a blog. As it is the case for most of gardens, it's never finished, only loosely tended, and evolves with time. To distinguish notes maturity though, they are marked by *season*:
-   `winter` – just started
-   `spring` – in progress but with good content already
-   `summer` – very solid and happy about it
-   `autumn` – needs some rewriting so not visible

If you'd like to know more about the backend of things, this is a customised version of [notenote.link](https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link), which is a fork of [simply-jekyll](https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll) optimised for integration with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Feel free to check out the full source code on [my GitHub](https://github.com/one-data-cookie/digi-garden).
