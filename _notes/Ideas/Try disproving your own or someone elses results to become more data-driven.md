What to do? Removing context in a way that what is true in some context is a manipulation in another.

How to go against? "How can I disprove it?"

- *Psychology* (system 1/2 thinking, beliefs, too good to be true, biases: Anchors, Framing)
- *Visualisations* (cumulative sums, cutting axes)
- *Calculations* (100% and 50% = 0%, mean vs median with rich people, sample size differences, extrapolation)
- *Data Collection* (ask wrong question to wrong people, correlation/causation)
